# ODDS — Core Digital Design Suite (DDS)

The One-stop Digital Design Suite (DDS). Manna From Heaven for the digital world. Powered by the WE-i!™ methodology.

This repository contains the core framework for ODDS — a modular design & delivery platform including:
- Core library (APIs, data models, utilities)
- Design System (React components, tokens, Storybook)
- Asset & brand management (logos, guidelines)
- CLI and scaffolding for new projects

Goals
- Provide a single, reusable source of truth for design tokens, components, and platform APIs.
- Enable designers and developers to ship consistent digital experiences quickly.
- Make ODDS components and assets easy to discover, test, and reuse.

Quick start (developer)
1. Install dependencies:
   - npm install
2. Start development (core + design system):
   - npm run dev
3. Run tests:
   - npm test

See docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/ROADMAP.md for details.
